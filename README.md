# About

This is my implementation of a subgraph for a typical ERC20 token - in this case one called Cronos token.

You can see the smart contract address on Etherscan here.

# Setup

This was created by following the Quick Start tutorial, specifying the Cronos smart token address on Ethereum as the address.
